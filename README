= Open blog engine, written in PHP

== What's openblog?

openblog is a simple blog engine, written in PHP. I was hired to write a
blog engine and the requirements were fairly easy, I wanted to make sure
I can write such a software, so I wrote it.

It has the following benefits:

- requires only PHP and MySQL

- it's small, so if you want to customize it, you can do it easily,
  since understanding the whole source code is not a problem

- it has an integrated rich text editor, clean URLs, RSS, so everything
  what is needed in a general blog.

== Status

Maintaining software is always a pain and given that I'm no longer paid
for doing so, I recently switched to
http://b2evolution.net/[b2evolution].

== Download

----
darcs get --partial http://vmiklos.hu/project/openblog
----

should be able to download the code.

== How does it work?

I think all you have to modify is renaming `htaccess.sample` to
`.htaccess` and finetuning `config.php`, especially the MySQL password
part.

== Samples

A sample installation of openblog is available
